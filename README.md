# Weather_API_challenge
Module 6 homework

Overall Comment: This was a very time consuming and very rewarding homework assignment. Learning how to use APIs is difficult and will take a lot of practice and I learned that reading API documentation is critical to succcess. I had very helful tutors and Ask BCS learning assistants to help with this assignment. Open AI also was useful: It did not instruct me on how to code, however it did help me identify errors in my code and I then found resources on the web to correct my coding. Overall, I spent approximately 15 hours on this assignment. I consider it well worth the time and effort.

   Comment: I looked at this code for the weather API portion of the assignment for guidance. It was somewhat helpful, however I spent a lot of time figuring out how to code the correct API call on my own and with help from tutors.
